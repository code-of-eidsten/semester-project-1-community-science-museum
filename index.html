            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science?
            <br />Come on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do!
            <br /><br />
            You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why
            not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth?
            <br /><br />Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for
            interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and
            explore.<br />
            We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
            Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
            experiment with our team of experts.
            <br /><br />
            During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you
            can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.
            Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. <br />
            To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send
            us a message.
