            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
            down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do! You can learn
            about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel
            back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are
            designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you
            come ready to learn and explore. We also have the Young Stars club
            which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where
            you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.
            During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you
            can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.
            Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about
            the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.
