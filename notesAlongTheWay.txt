3. Dec
Started by editing the project board from the last assignment without copying it. And it had not been graded yet soo.. Welllp! Awful start. :'(

4. Dec
Made a new project board, started sketching out the rough of the different pages. Went down a rabbithole about how to pick color chemes and styles

5. Dec
Chose colorpalette with help from https://paletton.com/ - started using the colors and fleshing out a design

6. Dec
Filled in text on the different sketchpages, started checking out typography.  I'm going to use one font with sans serif. Now I only have to select 
a "sciency" and readable font - preferably a "basic"/standard font wich is widely supported and web-safe.
I think I will go for Verdana sans-serif (wich is easily readable even when the text is really small) or the slightly more elegant looking Georgia.. 
but this one HAS serifs

8. Dec
It seems neither Georgia or Verdana is a fontstyle that exists in Figma - although "Bebas Neue" seems to be the one other people use to make a 
"verdana like" font for others to download/add to their own Figma project.. why not just use the Bebas Neue then? 
Finished the style guide on figma, and made the three wireframe pages ready for tomorrow

9. Dec
Started on the PC wireframes, decided not to use the backgroundcolor from the sketches because frankly; it looked ugly. I'm sticking to a dark theme with splashes of
color. Made components for the navbar for pc, tablet and mobile, and footer for all three as well. Started working on the PC homepage.

10. Dec
Finished the Homepage - I might change things up a bit later, but for now I'm happy with it:)
On to the Exhibitionspage!

03. Jan
The rest of december was super hectic both at work and in my privatelife, but I've now managed to make the wireframes PC, Tablet and Mobile.
Updated the projectboard, and I'm going to make the neccesary HTML files today (hopefully)
